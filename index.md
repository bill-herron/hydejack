 <p>Hi, I'm Bill Herron.  I founded <span style="color:#171f53; font-weight: bold;">Zanden Communications</span> in 1991, providing communications integration services to primarily Fortune 1000 companies.
   Among my current interests is the use of Data Science in the Gaming Payments industry to discover hidden patterns and relationships that can result in better decisions.
