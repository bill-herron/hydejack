## PRIVACY POLICY
{:.no_toc}

August 24, 2020

We don't collect any personal data. This site is a static site,
doesn't include a database, and doesn't use cookies of any
sort (even for Google Analytics, which we don't use, either).

### Third Party Privacy

We do use one third party plugin that is capable of collecting data: [Discus Blog Commenting Plugin Privacy Policy]{:.heading.flip-title}.

They way we have implemented this plugin requires you to register with Discus before you can post any comments.
This is not particularly convenient for users who want to quickly add comments, but we thought it
was the most secure way to safeguard sensitive data for users interested in commenting on our posts.
