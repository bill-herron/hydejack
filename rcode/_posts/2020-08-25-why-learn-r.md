  R is both a language and environment for statistical computing.  [What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html#:~:text=The%20S%20language%20is%20often,to%20participation%20in%20that%20activity.&text=R%20is%20available%20as%20Free,License%20in%20source%20code%20form.).

The R Language is not the only tool available for manipulating and analysing data, but it is a good place to start.

When I first got interested in Data Science, I had a hard time figuring out where to begin.  The choice of tools was a little
overwhelming.  I narrowed down my choices to three, listed in order of most difficult to least difficult to master:

|Language |Common IDE |
| :-- | :-- |
| R | [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) |
| Python | [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)  |
| Tableau | [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download)  |

These tools are not really all the same, but they can all be used for Data Science projects.  Here is a
nice [comparision](https://www.stoltzmanconsulting.com/blog/tool-selection-python-tableau-r) of the tools listed above. 

Reading through many articles and trying out each tool, I came to the following conclusions:

1.  **R and RStudio:**

    Although this is hardest combination to learn, R is the tool that most academics are
	familiar with, and the tool used most often by very large companies.  There are about 16174
	packages (libraries) that are available for R, so third party support is very extensive.
	
2.  **Python and Jupyter:**

    Python is a very popular general purpose programming language, and in combination with Jupyter,
    can probably do just about all R/RStudio can.  It might be a little light on visualization capabilities.
    Programmers who are making the jump into Data Science might gravitate toward Python, possibly only
    because they are already familiar with the language or because the programming paradigm seems familiar. 

3.  **Tableau and Tableau Desktop:**
    
    Much easier to learn compared to the above listed tools, although using the advanced capabilities
    of Tableau has a steeper learning curve.  Certainly the Tableau dashboards you can create look
    impressive, and a lot of Data Science jobs postings list Tableau experience as as requirement.

	
In the end, I decided to [learn R first](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/why-use-the-r-language/).  The R IDE (RStudio) is very nice, is available as open source
and readily installed on my laptop. It can run locally on your desktop, or on a server for really big
datasets.  Third party support is very extensive, and the number and quality of tutorials
I found on-line was impressive.  I liked that I was able to build dashboards from withing R (using Shiny and Shinydashboard)
and that many R references and articles I found emphasized the statistical meaning of R's output (a lot of
the authors were academic and obviously had a good grounding in statistics and mathematics).
